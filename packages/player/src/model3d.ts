 * The link between the player and the 3D runtime (three.js), which lives in a separate script,

 *
 * Every frame of a 3D layer is a pure function of a small state object: presets tween the state on the
 * scene's timeline, and the player asks the runtime to draw it whenever the timeline updates. The
 * runtime never animates on its own, so 3D seeks, scrubs and loops exactly like everything else.
