# Unyson+ Animation Studio

A browser studio for timeline motion graphics: kinetic type, shapes, images and (later) 3D, laid out on a
timeline and exported as **plain HTML** for website heroes and sections, not video.

Live at **https://animation-studio.unysonplus.com/**. The plan and roadmap are on the docs site:
https://docs.unysonplus.com/animation-studio

## What's here

| Folder | What it is |
|---|---|
| `packages/player` | The scene player: the scene file format (`schema/scene.schema.json`), its validator, the responsive stage, the preset catalogue and the GSAP timeline builder. Builds to `dist/scene-player.iife.js` (the self-contained script exported pages load) and `dist/scene-editor.iife.js` (the Studio's in-preview editor: selection, dragging, resizing and in-place text editing; never shipped in exports). |
| `apps/studio` | The Studio web app (React + TypeScript + Vite): a preset library, a device-sized preview you edit directly (select one or many, drag, resize, double-click to edit text, Align and Distribute, lock layers), a timeline (drag, trim, zoom, drop presets), an inspector with per-breakpoint layouts, undo and redo, browser autosave, project files (`.scene.json`) and HTML export. |

## Develop

Requires Node.js 20 or newer.

```
npm install
npm run dev        # builds the player, then serves the Studio at http://localhost:5173
npm run build      # production build into apps/studio/dist
npm run typecheck
```

After changing the player, run `npm run build:player` (the Studio inlines the built player into its preview
and its exported files).

## The scene file in brief

A scene has a **stage** (an aspect ratio per breakpoint, a height mode and a safe area), **layers** drawn
bottom to top (text, shapes, images), and on each layer the **clips** that animate it. A clip is a preset
placed in time with its own settings. Positions are percentages of the stage and sizes are "stage units"
(1 = 1% of the stage width), so a scene draws the same at any size. Each breakpoint can override a layer's
position, size and type; the clips are shared.

Groups: a `group` layer holds `layers` of its own. Its children keep stage coordinates (grouping never moves
anything) and their clips run on the group's clock, starting at the group's `start`, so moving a group in time
moves its whole animation. Presets on the group itself animate its measured frame as a whole.

Height modes:

- `ratio` keeps the shape; the page scrolls if the stage is taller than the window.
- `ratio-capped` keeps the shape but never grows taller than the window; the designed frame is trimmed
  top and bottom, which the safe area allows for.
- `fill` is exactly one window tall.

Presets (22): text `text-rise`, `text-slam`, `text-stretch`, `text-scramble`, `text-typewriter`, `text-blur`,
`text-flip`, `text-tracking`; reveal and exit `fade`, `wipe`, `iris`, `slide`, `grow`; move and scale `pop`,
`zoom`, `spin`, `keyframes`; emphasis `text-wave`, `pulse`, `shake`, `float`, `recolor`. Their settings are
described in `packages/player/src/presets/catalog.ts`, which the Studio uses to build its forms.

## Two ways to make a scene

- **By hand.** Drag presets onto the timeline. Their defaults follow measured motion-design timing, and
  **Check scene** (the Check tab) points out what could be better as you work: text that leaves before it
  can be read, text too small on a screen size, text off the stage or on other text, two clips fighting
  over one layer, long stretches where nothing moves. Most items have a one-click fix.
- **With AI, then by hand.** **✦ AI assist** (bottom right of the stage) is a chat with the AI Dev Kit on
  your computer. Each answer is a change to the scene: one undo step, a "Go back to before this" link,
  and a Check scene count. Select layers first to change only those. Check scene's **Fix with AI** sends
  its findings to the AI.

The AI writes scene data only, never code, and receives the Studio's motion rules with every request
(`apps/studio/src/lib/motionRules.ts`), the same rules Check scene measures.

### Motion rules and eases

Clips can use twelve **measured eases** (Soft land, Snap and settle, Glide, Whip, Pop over, Crash in,
Bounce hard, Cruise, Soft in-out, Gentle in, Leave, Crash out), listed first in the Easing menu with what
each is for. Exits default to **Leave**, which speeds up out of frame. Staggered text presets have a
**Rhythm** setting: natural (uneven, seeded gaps, the default) or even.

The ease parameters and several timing rules come from frame-by-frame measurements of professional motion
pieces published in the motionmaxxing project (Apache-2.0); the review checklist ideas also draw on the
favstash AI video editing skills (Apache-2.0). Both are re-expressed here in our own code.

### Full screen and transitions

The **full screen** icon at the right of the stage toolbar (or **F**) plays the scene at your screen's real size,
without the editor; Space plays and pauses, Esc exits. With a group selected, **Transition to the next group** in the
Inspector hands it over to the next group in time: Crossfade, Push, Zoom through, Soft wipe, Blinds, Iris or 3D turn.
It writes a matched exit and entrance as ordinary clips and starts the next group as the transition begins.

### 3D layers

**+ 3D** adds a 3D layer, drawn by three.js inside the layer's box: **3D text** (Inter ExtraBold, extruded with
rounded edges), a **shape** (rounded box, sphere, ring, knot, cylinder, crystal), an **SVG logo** extruded from its
filled shapes, or a **glTF / GLB model** (an address or an upload). Finishes: matte, satin, glossy, metal, chrome,
lit by a built-in studio environment. The 3D presets (**Spin 3D**, **Tumble in**, **Orbit**, **Camera push**) turn
the object and move the camera; whole-layer presets (fade, slide, pop…) work too.

Every 3D frame is drawn from a small state the timeline animates (no animation loop of its own), so 3D seeks,
scrubs, loops and scroll-links like everything else. The runtime is a separate file, `scene-3d.js` (three.js
and the 3D font, about 210 KB gzipped), published next to each player version and loaded only by scenes with a
3D layer. Downloaded pages carry it inside when they need it. The 3D font is built from Inter
(`scripts/make-3d-font.mjs`, SIL OFL 1.1).

### Keyframes and curves

A **Keyframes** clip animates Move X/Y (% of the layer's size), scale, rotation, opacity and blur, each property
on its own track between the keyframes that set it. In the Inspector: **Add keyframe at playhead**, pick a
keyframe to edit its values (empty = not keyed there; the grey number is the in-between value), and shape the
move into it with a named ease or a **custom curve** (drag two handles; stored as `cubic(x1,y1,x2,y2)` and played
by the player itself, no plugin). With the clip selected and the playhead inside it, **dragging the layer on the
stage** sets its Move X/Y keyframe at the playhead. Diamonds on the timeline select keyframes and drag them in time.

### Scroll-linked playback

Set **Starts** to **As the page scrolls** and the page's scroll position becomes the playhead, forwards and back.
**Pin while playing** holds the stage still (CSS sticky, below the scene's header offset) for **Scroll length**
window heights; unpinned, the scene runs while the stage crosses the window. **Smoothing** lets the playhead
glide to the scroll position. Written without a scroll plugin (`packages/player/src/scroll.ts`). Pinning needs
every ancestor to have visible overflow; where a theme hides it, the scene still plays as it scrolls through.
**Try scrolling in a test page** (Inspector → Playback) opens the scene between stand-in page content.

### Self-test

`npm run selftest` plays a scene using every preset frame by frame, then jumps to the same frames in a
random order and checks they draw the same (`packages/player/test/selftest.html`). It needs Playwright
with Chromium (set `PLAYWRIGHT_DIR` to an existing install). Run it after changing the player.

## Exporting

**Export** in the Studio offers two things:

- **Web page:** one `.html` file carrying the scene and its own copy of the player. Optionally embeds the
  web fonts (Latin character sets) so the page works offline and loads nothing from a font service.
- **Embed code:** the scene inline, plus a `<script>` that loads the player from its permanent, versioned
  address, for pasting into any page (for example a Custom HTML block in WordPress):

```html
<div data-upw-scene>
  <script type="application/json">{ ...scene file... }</script>
</div>
<script src="https://animation-studio.unysonplus.com/player/0.0.10/scene-player.js" defer></script>
```

### Player versions are permanent

Every player version is published once, at `apps/studio/public/player/<version>/`, and never changes, so an
embedded scene keeps playing exactly as it was made. `npm run build:player` publishes a new version
automatically and **stops the build if the player's code changed without a version bump** in
`packages/player/package.json`. Commit the new folder: the site is rebuilt from the repository on each
deploy, so only committed versions stay online.

## Release stage

The Studio is in **alpha**: features are still missing and the scene file format may change between
versions. Exported pages and embeds keep working regardless, since they carry or pin their player.

## Deploy

Pushing to `main` builds the Studio and publishes it to GitHub Pages (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`).
