  return `VOICE-OVER SCENE (this request): the scene is built ON a voice-over that is already on the timeline. The request's "context" lists the voice's BEATS: "start-end: "words"" in scene seconds, with the STRONG (most emphasised) words and their times, and pauses.
- Make kinetic typography that follows the voice. For each beat show its KEY words, usually 1-5 (the words that carry the meaning, not the whole sentence: this is not captions). Merge short beats that belong together; skip filler.
- TIMING IS THE VOICE: a beat's words start entering 0.05-0.15 s before they are said and are fully readable while they are said. Never show words before they are spoken. Each beat's text leaves (or is replaced) as the next beat starts, so at most two text layers are on screen at once.
- STRONG words: give them the biggest type or the accent colour, and land a hit exactly on their time (a slam, pop, scale or recolour landing at the word's time, with a clip "sound" such as impact, pop or thud at "at": "end" or start so the sound falls on the word).
- A pause of 0.6 s or more is a change of idea: use a transition there (a wipe, a soft-wipe, a whoosh exit) or a held frame. The biggest idea gets the biggest moment; a riser can lead into it.
- Delivery: ${(sp.delivery ?? ['conversational']).join(', ')}, ${sp.wpm ? `${sp.wpm} words a minute` : 'unknown pace'}. Make the motion ${mood}.
- Keep the voice the star: sounds sparse (about one per 1.5-3 s, volume 0.5-0.8), on strong words and transitions only.
- Lay text out large and centred (or in a strong layout per beat), always inside the safe area, at least the minimum sizes. A background shape or slow ambient motion can run underneath the whole scene.
- The scene lasts until the voice ends plus about 0.6 s: duration ${Math.ceil((end + 0.6) * 10) / 10}. Do not loop ("loop": false). Do not add, remove or change "audio".
- Name layers after their words. Use "start"/"end" on layers (or exit clips) so each layer is only there for its beat.`;
